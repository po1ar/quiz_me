# QuizMe

QuizMe is a web application that allows students to create custom study sets with the help of artificial intelligence. QuizMe was born from my friends that I couldn't build such a web app over the weekend. By leveraging the latest technologies in natural language processing and machine learning, QuizMe can automatically generate questions and answers based on any topic, making it easier for students to reinforce their knowledge.

## Features
- **Custom study sets**: Students can create their own study sets by filling out the questionare to get tailored results.
- **AI-powered questions**: QuizMe uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to generate questions and answers based on the content of your answers. This makes studying more interactive and engaging, as students can reinforce their knowledge.
- **Responsive design**: QuizMe is built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, which allows it to be fully responsive and accessible on any desktop device.

## Getting started

To use QuizMe, simply go to our dev build [(hosted on Vercel!)](https://quizme-eight.vercel.app) and build your own custom study guide!


## To Run Locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Future Updates 
- [ ] Users can upload their notes and it'll scan and convert to text (using OCR)
- [ ] Users can export their study guides in .txt, .docx, and .pdf

## Final Thoughts
This project helped me reinforce my knowledge with Nextjs/Tailwind. Although I've had some experience building with Next+Tailwind, this projected helped me get more used w/it. I also learned how to properly use the OpenAI API in order to retrieve data. Although this is was a weekend project, I do hope to come back to this and add certain functionality (listed above).
